keystroke-id
============


Graph the order you type some word, and put true when that order is maintained as you type several times your initial word.

Example:

1. Open `main.html` in a browser.
2. Write a word and wait till the graphic is rendered.
3. Write the same word several times, and observe that when your typing order changes, page will tell you.
